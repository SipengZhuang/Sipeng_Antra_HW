--1. I will choose to use join instead of subquery, because it could mkae my code clean and neat, however, subquery has it's own advantage like calculate the sum of set value.
    in terms of run time and memory occupancy, join is better than subqueery, because join has less logic read and scan.
--2. CTE can be use to organized complex code into simple code block, create recursive query, improve readability and managebility
--3. variable table is special type of temp table to help store thee data, while maintaining all the properties from the local variable  the variable table is stored at tempdb 
--4. delete statement is used to delete one or multiple row in a table,deleting rows from the table will retain the row identity and does not reset it to the seed value.
    truncate used to remove all rows by deallocating the page and leaving no log, or retain the identity. In terms of performance, truncate has faster executiont time becauseh
     truncate erase all row identity.
     
--5. delete will retain the identity column and truncate remove them all.
--6 . delete table erase the table completely, while truncate remove all data from the table, but it won't remove the columns, indexes, constraint and schema.
